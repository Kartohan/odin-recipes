        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht" is most often associated 
                    with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its 
                    distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such 
                    as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht, and cabbage borscht.</p>

                    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place water, salt, carrots, 1/2 of the bell pepper, celery, beet, tomatoes, and quartered potatoes in a large stock pot over high heat. 
                        Bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Melt 1/3 cup butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, 
                        reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove 1/2 cup of sauce from skillet, and set aside. Stir half of the cabbage into 
                        the skillet with remaining sauce, and continue simmering 5 minutes more, or until tender.</li>
                    <li>Remove beet from boiling liquid and discard. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon or tongs, and place in a bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon
                        of butter and the cream. Mash together until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Return the 1/2 cup of reserved onion-tomato sauce to the stock pot. Stir in diced potatoes, and simmer until just tender but still firm, 
                        approximately 5 minutes. Increase heat to a low boil, and stir in remaining cabbage, tomato sauce, and mashed potatoes. Reduce heat and 
                        simmer a few minutes more. Stir in remaining bell pepper, season with black pepper, and serve.</li>
