            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Raw plums right from the tree to make jelly that will keep in a home canning jar on the pantry shelf until opened. 
                If processing for canning then mixture should be a bit watery. The canning process will thicken the jelly.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Â½ pounds fresh plums, pitted and halved</li>
                    <li>4 cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 cups water</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Combine plums, sugar, and water in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. 
                    Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until mixture has thickened to desired consistency, 
                    30 to 40 minutes.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Meanwhile, inspect five 8-ounce jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering 
                    water until jelly is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.</p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Remove jelly from the heat and skim off any heavy foam. Ladle hot jelly into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/2 
                    inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with 
                    a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on finger-tight.</p>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart 
                    into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, 
                    cover, and process for 15 minutes. Remove jars from water bath and tighten rings.</p>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Place jars on a towel to cool until lids pop. Press lids to confirm the seal.</p>
