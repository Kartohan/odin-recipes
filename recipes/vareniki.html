                <h3>To Cook Vareniky:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To mix the dough, combine the milk, sunflower oil, egg yolk, flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. 
                        You can use an electric mixer or knead the dough by hand until it forms a smooth, stiff dough. Shape the dough into a log, 
                        wrap it in plastic wrap, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Soak the dried porcini in 1/2 cup hot water for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in boiling salted water to cover 
                        until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.</li>
                    <li>Chop the rehydrated mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid. Mash the potatoes, adding the mushroom-soaking liquid to moisten.</li>
                    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onions; cook and stir until the onion has softened and 
                        turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Mix the mashed potatoes, onions, and mushrooms; season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the filling aside while you roll out 
                        the vareniky dough.</li>
                    <li>Cut the dough into discs about 3/8 inch thick and 2 inches wide (1 cm thick and 5 cm in diameter). Flatten or roll each disc on a 
                        lightly floured surface to make a thin circle. Drop the filling by tablespoonfuls into the center of each vareniky; fold the dough 
                        in half and pinch the edge to seal. Repeat until all of the dumplings are filled.</li>
                    <li>Bring the gallon of water and tablespoon of salt to a boil in a large pot. Add the vareniky to the boiling water and stir once, gently. 
                        Simmer until all of the dumplings have floated to the surface, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well before serving.</li>
